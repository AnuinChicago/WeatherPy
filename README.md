1. There is very good corelation between temperature and the lalitude. We see in both hemispheres, that as we go closer to the equator the temperature increases.
2. There is no corelation between humididity or cloudiness and lalitude in both the hemispheres.
3. There is some level of corelation between Laltitude and Wind speed. As we move away from the quator towards the poles, we notice higher wind speeds.
